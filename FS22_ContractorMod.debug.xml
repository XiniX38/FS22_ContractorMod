<!--
    Simply copy this file in your mods directory to enable ContractorMod debug commands.
    If you want to configure passenger for a new vehicle, add this kind of line to your ContractorMod.xml file.
    Sample are already present in this file to help you understand.

    <Passenger vehiclesName="$moddir$FS22_Mod_Name/FS22_Mod_File.xml" seatIndex="1" x="0.0" y="0.0" z="0.0" rx="0" ry="0" rz="0" />

    Then you can enter the vehicle with 2 characters and move the passenger to position it as you want by using following keys:
        MOVE_PASS_LEFT   : KEY_lctrl KEY_a
        MOVE_PASS_RIGHT  : KEY_lctrl KEY_d
        MOVE_PASS_TOP    : KEY_lctrl KEY_q
        MOVE_PASS_BOTTOM : KEY_lctrl KEY_z
        MOVE_PASS_FRONT  : KEY_lctrl KEY_w
        MOVE_PASS_BACK   : KEY_lctrl KEY_s
    Finally use this key to write in the log the line you will then replace in ContractorMod.xml file located in your mods directory.
        DUMP_PASS        : KEY_lctrl KEY_e
